          Hello! I&apos;m{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Jethro Cadang</span>, a
          fresh graduate with a BS in Information Systems. While I&apos;m still
          growing in my field, I&apos;m committed to becoming competitive
          through continuous learning and hands-on experience.

        <p>
          My programming journey began during my third year when I decided to
          explore uncharted territory. Originally focused on project management,
          I discovered that programming offered something more fulfillingâ€”the
          incredible satisfaction of solving complex problems through code.
        </p>

        <p>
          This led me to start building web applications with{" "}
          <span className="font-medium">Next.js</span>, a framework that
          immediately captured my interest with its excellent documentation and
          powerful capabilities. What started as curiosity quickly transformed
          into a genuine passion for creating clean, readable, and efficient
          codebases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I&apos;m dedicated to keeping pace with our rapidly evolving
          tech landscape by building practical web applications and tackling
          real-world problems. Each project is an opportunity to learn something
          new and push my skills further.
