              , a fresh graduate with a BS in Information Systems. While

              My programming journey began during my third year when I decided
              to explore uncharted territory. Originally focused on project
              management, I discovered that programming offered something more
              fulfillingâ€”the incredible satisfaction of solving complex problems
              through code.

              This led me to start building web applications with{" "}
              <span className="font-medium">Next.js</span>, a framework that
              immediately captured my interest with its excellent documentation
              and powerful capabilities. What started as curiosity quickly
              transformed into a genuine passion for creating clean, readable,
              and efficient codebases.

              Today, I&apos;m dedicated to keeping pace with our rapidly
              evolving tech landscape by building practical web applications and
              tackling real-world problems. Each project is an opportunity to
              learn something new and push my skills further.
